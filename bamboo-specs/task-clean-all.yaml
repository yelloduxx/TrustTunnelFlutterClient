# Well, we have a little interesting problem with docker and bamboo.
# Imagine the following situation:
# - A Bamboo agent with user 'agent1' checkouts a git repo;
# - The agent runs a docker container with user 'root', which creates a file in the same directory as the git repo exists;
#
# After this, the agent tries to clean a directory, but it can't because a different user created a file to the git repo.
# To workaround this behavior, we just remove the root directory from the docker itself.
